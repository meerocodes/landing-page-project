# landing-page-project
my first project not being handheld. I look forward to creating this page and hoepfully I dont lose my mind over a "</div>" that is ruining my entire codes intergrity. 
Pretty solid for a days work. Some stuff I wish looked better when my screen is narrow however I am happy with the final product.
